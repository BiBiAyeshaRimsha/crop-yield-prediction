# **Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

Crop yield prediction using machine learning is an advanced approach that leverages data-driven models to estimate agricultural productivity. Traditional methods rely on historical data and expert knowledge, but machine learning enhances accuracy by analyzing large datasets, including weather patterns, soil properties, satellite imagery, and farming practices. Techniques such as regression models, decision trees, neural networks, and deep learning algorithms help identify complex relationships between factors affecting yield. This approach enables farmers and policymakers to make informed decisions, optimize resource use, and improve food security.
